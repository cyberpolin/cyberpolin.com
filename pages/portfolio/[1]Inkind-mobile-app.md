# Inkind Mobile App

Inkind is a really global app present on USA, Australia, New Zealand and recently Canada. I&#39;ve been working for them as a freelancer for more than 4 years now.

This is a set of two apps using a RoR backend, both apps were coded with React Native using Typescript, an we set up a CI tool using appcenter, so the deploy and even distrivution for testing are automatic, both apps are big and we use push notifications, firebase integrations, apple payment and a bunch of animations using React-animations which allow to use a thread other than the one JS use, so they look and feel **fast**.
