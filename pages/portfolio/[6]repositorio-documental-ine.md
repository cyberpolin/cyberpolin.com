# Documents Repository for INE

Using **React Native**, **open AI** and **react-native-reanimated** I did as an excercise this application from scratch.

The main idea is just to transcript from voice to text using latest AI tech from our friends from open AI. Basically we locally record a mp3, which is sent to open AI api, and we get back the text.

Once we got the text, is time to display it as a new item. Please notice the animations using the native thread.
