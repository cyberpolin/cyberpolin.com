# Yum Delivery

This was a personal project, a team I put together and I made this Uber Eats clone, and distributed through the stores, currently is working as a standalone project and it's own enterprise.

I used a _Django_ backend, with _Firebase_ implementation for some functions as real time updates, me and the team I assemble use _React Native_ to make this app available for both Android and Ios with a single base code, because of real time traking issue we use a native module to track in the background.

_I've also developed a complete solution from scratch, so if you want a uber eats clone right away, [ask for a quote](cp-food-delivery)._ I will be pleased to help your business start in no time.
