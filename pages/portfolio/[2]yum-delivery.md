# Yum Delivery

This was a personal project, a team I put together and I made this Uber Eats clone, and distributed through the stores, currently is working as a standalone project and it's own enterprise.

I used a *Django* backend, with *Firebase* implementation for some functions as real time updates, me and the team I assemble use *React Native* to make this app available for both Android and Ios with a single base code, because of real time traking issue we use a native module to track in the background.
